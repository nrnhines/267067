mechanisms/branching.mod is not compatible with coreneuron and is not
needed there. I modify nrnivmodl-core with 3 lines so that
for mod_dir in "${ROOT_DIR}/share/modfile" "$params_MODS_PATH" ;
do  
    # copy mod files and include files
    files=( "$mod_dir/"*.mod "$mod_dir/"*.inc "$mod_dir/"*.h* )
    for f in "${files[@]}";
    do
        if [[ $f == *"branching.mod" ]]; then
            echo "skipping $f"
            continue
        fi
        # copy mod files only if it's changed (to avoid rebuild)
